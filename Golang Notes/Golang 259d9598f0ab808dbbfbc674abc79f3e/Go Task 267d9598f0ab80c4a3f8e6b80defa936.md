# Go Task

## 🔹 **Day 1 – Entities & Business Rules**

👉 Goal: Get comfortable with **structs, constants, decisions**.

1. Create a `Customer` struct (`ID, Name, Balance`) and print details.
2. Write a function to increase/decrease balance.
3. Create an `Order` struct (`OrderID, Symbol, Quantity, Price`) + method `TotalValue()`.
4. Use `if/else` to check if customer’s balance ≥ 50,000 → loan eligible.
5. Use `switch` to calculate commission rate (equities/bonds/options).
6. Use constants for `ACCOUNT_SAVINGS, ACCOUNT_CHECKING, ACCOUNT_BROKERAGE`. Print the type.
7. Write a function to **validate an order** (quantity > 0, price > 0, else return error).

---

## 🔹 **Day 2 – Collections & Loops**

👉 Goal: Practice **for, slices, arrays, maps** with business-style problems.

1. Store 5 stock symbols in a slice, loop and print them.
2. Store 10 daily stock prices in an array → calculate average.
3. Loop over a slice of orders → print only “buy” orders.
4. Store balances in a map `map[int]float64` → update one customer’s balance.
5. Create a map of stock holdings (`symbol -> quantity`), update and print.
6. Given a slice of trades, collect **unique symbols** into a map.
7. Write a function `FindMaxBalance(customers)` that returns customer with highest balance.

---

## 🔹 **Day 3 – Structs + Methods + Error Handling**

👉 Goal: Simulate **mini business flows** with methods + functions.

1. Add method `IsBuy()` to `Order` struct (returns true if type == "buy").
2. Add method `PrintSummary()` to `Portfolio` (loop orders, print total investment).
3. Write a function `TransferFunds(cust1, cust2, amount)` (decrease from one, increase other).
4. Write a function `ApplyTax(trade, taxRate)` that deducts tax from profit.
5. Write a function `CheckStockSymbol(symbol string)` → returns error if not in allowed list (`AAPL, TSLA, MSFT`).
6. Create an array of `Employees` → loop and print only those with Age > 30.
7. Write a function that pays **dividends** → loops over customers and increases balance by a fixed % of holdings.

---

✅ By the end of **Day 3**, you’ll have covered:

- All basics (structs, vars, const, loops, maps, arrays).
- Realistic finance-style business problems.
- Error handling and functions.
- Struct methods (like domain modeling in Morgan ETrade project).

---

⚡ Strategy for each day:

- Pick 7 tasks (should take ~2–3 hrs total).
- Use your Notion notes as a **cheat sheet**.
- Don’t worry about remembering syntax perfectly — just solve problems.

---

👉 Do you want me to also give you a **“template project folder structure”** (like `cmd/`, `pkg/`, `models/`) so that while solving these tasks, you already practice in a way that looks like your company’s real Go microservice?

### You said:

Yes

### ChatGPT said:

Awesome 🚀 — then let’s set up a **mini project folder structure** that mirrors how most real-world Go microservices are organized (including what you’ll likely see in Morgan ETrade).

This way, even while doing your practice tasks, you’ll **train your brain to read/write Go code in the same structure as your company project**.

# 📂 Suggested Folder Structure

```
my-go-practice/
│── cmd/
│    └── main.go         # entry point (like Spring Boot main class)
│
│── pkg/                 # reusable business logic (services, utils)
│    ├── models/         # domain structs (Customer, Order, etc.)
│    │    ├── customer.go
│    │    ├── order.go
│    │    └── portfolio.go
│    │
│    ├── services/       # business functions (transfer, validation)
│    │    ├── customer_service.go
│    │    ├── order_service.go
│    │    └── portfolio_service.go
│    │
│    └── utils/          # helper functions (math, date, etc.)
│         └── math_utils.go
│
└── go.mod               # Go module file (like pom.xml / build.gradle)

# 🔹 File Role Mapping (Java → Go)

| Java (Spring Boot) | Go Equivalent in this setup |
| --- | --- |
| `@RestController` / `@Service` | functions in `services/` |
| `@Entity` / DTOs | structs in `models/` |
| `Application.java` (main class) | `cmd/main.go` |
| Utility classes (`Utils.java`) | functions in `utils/` |
| `pom.xml` / `gradle.build` | `go.mod` |

---

# 🔹 Example Walkthrough

### **models/customer.go**

```go
package models

type Customer struct {
    ID      int
    Name    string
    Balance float64
}

```

---

### **services/customer_service.go**

```go
package services

import (
    "errors"
    "my-go-practice/pkg/models"
)

func TransferFunds(from *models.Customer, to *models.Customer, amount float64) error {
    if from.Balance < amount {
        return errors.New("insufficient balance")
    }
    from.Balance -= amount
    to.Balance += amount
    return nil
}

```

---

### **cmd/main.go**

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "my-go-practice/pkg/models"
    "my-go-practice/pkg/services"
)

func main() {
    cust1 := models.Customer{ID: 1, Name: "Alice", Balance: 1000}
    cust2 := models.Customer{ID: 2, Name: "Bob", Balance: 500}

    err := services.TransferFunds(&cust1, &cust2, 300)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Transfer successful")
        fmt.Println("Alice balance:", cust1.Balance)
        fmt.Println("Bob balance:", cust2.Balance)
    }
}

```

# ✅ How You’ll Use This

- Each of your **Day 1 → Day 3 tasks** can fit inside this structure.
- Example:
    - Task "Customer struct" → goes in `models/customer.go`.
    - Task "Loan eligibility" → function in `services/customer_service.go`.
    - Task "Portfolio summary" → method in `models/portfolio.go`.
    - Main function (`cmd/main.go`) → test out the logic by calling functions.

---

👉 Do you want me to **pre-map all 30 tasks** into this folder structure (like “Task 7 → put in services/order_service.go”), so you know exactly where to place each file as you practice?

### You said:

But don't write solution

### ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 — I’ll only **map tasks into the folder structure** (no solutions, no code), so you know **where to implement each practice problem**. That way, your hands do the coding while your brain gets used to a **real-world Go microservice layout**.

# 📂 Task-to-Folder Mapping

### **Day 1 – Entities & Business Rules**

- Task 1: `Customer` struct → `pkg/models/customer.go`
- Task 2: Balance update function → `pkg/services/customer_service.go`
- Task 3: `Order` struct + `TotalValue()` method → `pkg/models/order.go`
- Task 4: Loan eligibility check → `pkg/services/customer_service.go`
- Task 5: Trade commission (`switch`) → `pkg/services/order_service.go`
- Task 6: Account type constants → `pkg/models/customer.go` (or a new `constants.go`)
- Task 7: Validate order → `pkg/services/order_service.go`

---

### **Day 2 – Collections & Loops**

- Task 8: Stock symbols slice → test inside `cmd/main.go`
- Task 9: Price history array + average → `pkg/utils/math_utils.go`
- Task 10: Loop orders & filter buys → `pkg/services/order_service.go`
- Task 11: Balances map (customerID → balance) → `pkg/services/customer_service.go`
- Task 12: Stock holdings map → `pkg/services/portfolio_service.go`
- Task 13: Unique stock symbols → `pkg/services/portfolio_service.go`
- Task 14: Find max balance → `pkg/services/customer_service.go`

---

### **Day 3 – Structs + Methods + Error Handling**

- Task 15: `Order.IsBuy()` method → `pkg/models/order.go`
- Task 16: `Portfolio.PrintSummary()` → `pkg/models/portfolio.go`
- Task 17: Transfer funds → `pkg/services/customer_service.go`
- Task 18: Apply tax → `pkg/services/order_service.go`
- Task 19: Check stock symbol → `pkg/services/order_service.go`
- Task 20: Employees array filter → `pkg/models/employee.go` + test in `cmd/main.go`
- Task 21: Dividend payments → `pkg/services/portfolio_service.go`

---

# ✅ How to Work

- Always **test your functions in `cmd/main.go`** → this simulates “wiring up” services like Spring Boot’s main app.
- Keep **entities (structs)** in `models/`.
- Keep **business logic** in `services/`.
- Keep **math/date/helpers** in `utils/`.
- Keep **entry point** in `cmd/main.go`.
